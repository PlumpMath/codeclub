        <p><strong>This game is designed to show you how to learn by yourself. You can do it. Keep going even when the going gets tough.</strong>

        </p> <strong>
        <p>All questions are optional and there are no right or wrong answers. Doing this list with some friends or a parent might be more fun!</p>
        <p>Do them in any order you like and share and improve your answers with friends, this is *not* a test! You can each do different questions and share at the end if you like.
        </p>
    </strong>

        <p>Be sure to write some questions, thoughts and keyword notes down for yourself and keep it safe, that is how you get smarter.</p>

        <p>Sometimes what makes some people the best at what they do is their perseverance even when things are really tough. Even if you don't understand a word of the question, still giving it a go and not beating yourself up if you don't get it right is a massive achievement. The best way to learn is to teach yourself, because that way there's no limit to what you can learn! If you're really up for a challenge, try a free GMAT test. These are made for people going to business school, some of the Tech Super Heroes have been here before you and they leave you a message that gives you hope on your way. If you get one question right that's a really good job! Go to <a target="_blank" href="http://j.mp/stanford-is-for-sissies">Problem Solving</a>. Check the explanation after you're done, even if you got it right - and be careful young adventurers, the force is strong within you, but these ones, they are designed to be tricky!</p>
